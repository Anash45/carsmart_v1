                                    <br><br> We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfil
                                    the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any
                                    legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. <br><br> To determine the appropriate
                                    retention period for Personal Data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity
                                    of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure
                                    of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we process your Personal Data and
                                    whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal
                                    requirements. <br><br> By law we have to keep basic information about our customers
                                    (including Contact, Identity, KYC, Financial and Transaction Data) for six (6) years
                                    after they cease being customers for tax and accounting purposes. <br><br> In some
                                    circumstances you can ask us to delete your Data: see clause 17 below for further
                                    information. <br><br> In some circumstances we may anonymise your Personal Data (so
                                    that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes
                                    in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to

                                    security measure to ensure that Personal Data is not disclosed to any person who has
                                    no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information

                                    Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly
                                    complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and
